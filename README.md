# DatabaseAdminPageStarter
The files necessary to embed SQL controls for a website directly into a web page: HTML 5.0 element with text-area and run query button, JavaScript AJAX function, PHP request script.

These files were created as examples to share with my students to get them started tieing these things together after they have taken classes covering databases, html & css, client-side scripting, and server-side scripting since none of the courses tie these things together in the curriculum. After sharing it with students a number of times I decided to stick it on here to just share the link instead of emailing the files.

Formal documentation and instruction videos coming soon.
